# 🌟 Inclusive Entrepreneurship Analytics

> Because every founder deserves their unicorn moment! 🦄

Hey there! Welcome to my SQL analytics project for tracking and analyzing programs that help underrepresented founders build amazing companies. As a VC associate who's tired of seeing the same pitch decks from the same demographics, I built this to help nonprofits that are actually moving the needle on entrepreneurship diversity.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This database tracks everything from donor management to program impact for nonprofits focused on making entrepreneurship more inclusive. Think of it as a "founder diversity analytics suite" that helps answer questions like:
- "How many underrepresented founders did we help launch companies this quarter?"
- "What's our cost per successful business launch?"
- "Are our mentorship programs actually working?"
- "Which donors are most passionate about inclusive entrepreneurship?"

## 📊 Features

### Core Analytics
- Comprehensive financial tracking (because even nonprofits need to watch their runway!)
- Impact measurement (the stuff that actually matters)
- Donor relationship management (gotta keep those checks flowing)
- Program effectiveness metrics (are we actually helping or just running expensive coffee chats?)

### Key Reports & Visualizations
- Monthly donation trends (pretty charts = happy board members)
- Program ROI analysis (because impact per dollar matters)
- Donor retention tracking (keeping the allies close)
- Impact metrics dashboard (proof that we're changing the game)
- Geographic reach analysis (we're going global, baby!)

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Database**: MySQL/PostgreSQL (dealer's choice)
- **Visualization Ready**: Compatible with your favorite BI tool
- **Sample Data**: Included (because testing with "foo" and "bar" is so 2010)
