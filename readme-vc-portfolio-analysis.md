## Technical Deep Dive üîç

### Database Schema Design

#### Companies Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE companies (
    company_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    company_name VARCHAR(100),
    sector VARCHAR(50),
    investment_stage VARCHAR(50),
    initial_investment_date DATE,
    exit_date DATE NULL,
    exit_type VARCHAR(50) NULL,
    status VARCHAR(20) CHECK (status IN ('Active', 'Exited', 'Written Off'))
);
```
- Implements status constraints
- Handles null exit dates/types for active companies
- Enables efficient indexing on commonly queried fields

#### Investment Rounds
```sql
CREATE TABLE investment_rounds (
    round_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    company_id INTEGER,
    round_date DATE,
    round_type VARCHAR(50),
    pre_money_valuation DECIMAL(15,2),
    amount_invested DECIMAL(15,2),
    ownership_percentage DECIMAL(5,2),
    FOREIGN KEY (company_id) REFERENCES companies(company_id)
);
```
- Maintains referential integrity
- Handles precise decimal calculations
- Tracks ownership dilution

#### Cash Flows
```sql
CREATE TABLE cash_flows (
    cash_flow_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    company_id INTEGER,
    flow_date DATE,
    amount DECIMAL(15,2),
    flow_type VARCHAR(20) CHECK (flow_type IN ('Investment', 'Distribution')),
    description VARCHAR(200),
    FOREIGN KEY (company_id) REFERENCES companies(company_id)
);
```
- Implements flow type constraints
- Enables complex financial calculations
- Supports detailed transaction tracking

### Advanced Queries Showcase üí´

#### 1. Vintage Year Analysis
```sql
WITH vintage_investments AS (
    SELECT 
        EXTRACT(YEAR FROM initial_investment_date) as vintage_year,
        company_id,
        SUM(CASE 
            WHEN cf.flow_type = 'Investment' 
            THEN ABS(cf.amount) 
            ELSE 0 
        END) as total_invested
    FROM companies c
    LEFT JOIN cash_flows cf ON c.company_id = cf.company_id
    GROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM initial_investment_date), company_id
)
-- Complete query in codebase
```
Demonstrates:
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Date manipulation
- Conditional aggregation
- Complex grouping

#### 2. Portfolio IRR Calculation
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_irr(company_id_param INTEGER)
RETURNS DECIMAL(10,2) AS $$
-- Function implementation in codebase
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```
Showcases:
- Custom function creation
- Financial mathematics in SQL
- Error handling
- Performance optimization

## Key Features & Implementation Details üõ†Ô∏è

- DPI (Distributions to Paid-In)
- RVPI (Residual Value to Paid-In)
- IRR (Internal Rate of Return)
- Cash-on-Cash multiple

#### Technical Highlights:
```sql
-- Example of complex performance calculation
WITH investment_metrics AS (
    SELECT 
        company_id,
        SUM(CASE 
            WHEN flow_type = 'Investment' 
            THEN ABS(amount) 
            ELSE 0 
        END) as total_invested,
        SUM(CASE 
            WHEN flow_type = 'Distribution' 
            THEN amount 
            ELSE 0
